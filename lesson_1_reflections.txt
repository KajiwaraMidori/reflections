1) How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

it was easy for me to understand the difference using diff command since it
I don't have to check the differences manually.

2) How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

If you got some errors on a newer version, you can always go back to the point
with no errors.To keep the program that works corretly is essential manner
for engineers.

3)What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, 
like Google Docs does?

It's easier for engineers to put meanings to each commits if you use git.
The good point of auto-saving is that you almost never loose your editing data.
